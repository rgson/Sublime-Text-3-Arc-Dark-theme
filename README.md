# Sublime Text 3 Arc-Dark theme

Once I'm done and figure out how to package this properly you won't have to do this below.

1. Place Arc-Dark folder in Packages/User
2. Open Arc-Dark-Master.sublime-theme with an editor and replace all custom asset paths with your own (unless default assets are used)
3. Place Widget.sublime-settings in Packages/User
4. add "theme": "Arc-Dark-Master.sublime-theme" to your user prefs file.
5. add "color_scheme": "Packages/User/Arc-Dark/schemes/Arc.tmTheme", to your prefs file or add through the user menu
